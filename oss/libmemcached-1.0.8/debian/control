Description: C and C++ client library to the memcached server
 libmemcached is a C and C++ client library to the memcached server
 (http://memcached.org/). It has been designed to be light on memory
 usage, thread safe, and provide full access to server side methods.
 .
 A few notes on its design:
 .
   * Synchronous and Asynchronous support.
   * Access to large object support.
   * Local replication.
   * TCP and Unix Socket protocols.
   * A half dozen or so different tuneable hash algorithms.
   * Implementations of the new cas, replace, and append operators.
   * Man pages written up on entire API.
   * Implements both modulo and consistent hashing solutions.
   * Tools to Manage your Memcached networks.
 .
 This package provides the libmemcached shared library itself.
