# 2003 - Jay Bonci <jaybonci@debian.org>
# This configuration file is read by the start-memcached script provided as
# part of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. 

# Run memcached as a daemon. This command is implied, and is not needed for the
# daemon to run. See the README.Debian that comes with this package for more
# information.

logfile /var/log/memcached.log

# -vv

# Very very verbose (internal state transitions too)
# -vvv

# Note that the daemon will grow to this size, but does not start out holding this much
# memory

# -u command is present in this config file

-c 2048

# Number of threads to be used
